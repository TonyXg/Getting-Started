This is based on my story Choose Your Class. 
Choose Your Class is a story about American people exploring another planet, which is eventually titled Acirema. 
Once, the people of the planet Acirema went to war, but it was too much to take; millions were dying to this war, and the end seemed impossible...
until one side unlocked magic. This one side was incredibly weak though, with only twelve warriors, which later became known as the Zodiac. 
The Zodiac learned the power of magic, and used it to win the war, and create peace on the planet Acirema. 
The planet Acirema always had a substance of great power. 
The Aciremian people call this unusual power magic, or often mana. Soon, the Zodiac start a system of teaching everyone of the planet Acirema to use mana in schools. 
That is where you come in...

You learn a magical class, meet some friends, and find the answers of Acirema.
Enjoy!
